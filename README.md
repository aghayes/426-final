# 426-final
Here is my final game for comp 426. Go to aidanhayes.us:3030 to play. You have to register for an account, please don't use a real password as the debug console prints it in plaintext. The server and the frontend talk to each other using websockets.

# backend
The backend is a custom rust backend that uses postgressql to handle login and saving darkmode. The code for it is in source code/rust/src.

# frontend
The front end is a react app with custom css. The css is adaptive and supports mobile. The css is in source code/react/public/stylesheet.css.
